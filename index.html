<h1>canDo.js</h1>
<p>canDo.js is a javascript library used for building simple UI elements such as buttons. It's meant to allow developers the luxury of adding Canvas based UI elements without adding a ton of overhead.</p>
<iframe style="width: 700px; height: 400px;clear:both;margin-top:32px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/dtex/YJP8S/embedded/result,js" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>canDo.js proxies the methods of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">HTML Canvas 2D Context</a> and allows you to add keyframes to the properties you pass in. canDo also gives you easing functions, playback control, image management and even some basic event handling.</p>
<p>You are still free to use the non-proxied built-in canvas functions when appropriate.</p>
<p>canDo.js is framework agnostic and pretty darn small (<strong>&lt; 6kb compressed</strong>).</p>
<p>canDo.js is not a scene graph manager, a game engine, or a drawing tool. If canDo.js doesn't solve your needs, check out some of these Canvas based projects:</li>
<ul> 
	<li><a href="http://visitmix.com/labs/ai2canvas/">Ai->Canvas (size varies)</a> - This Adobe Illustrator plug-in allows you to build an animation in Illustrator and export to Canvas. It was built by @tommylee from Microsoft.</li>
	<li><a href="http://fabricjs.com/">fabric.js (~124kb compressed)</a> - "Fabric.js is a framework that makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas element. It is an interactive object model on top of canvas element. It is also an SVG-to-canvas (and canvas-to-SVG) parser." This one was built by @kangax .</li>
	<li><a href="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js (~130kb compressed)</a> - "[paper.js] offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface. Credit @juerglehni and @jonathanpuckey for this.</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/cakejs/">cake.js (~100kb compressed)</a> - "CAKE is a JavaScript scene graph library for the HTML5 canvas tag. You could think of it as SVG sans the XML and not be too far off."</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperandroid/CAAT">CAAT (&gt; 200kb compressed)</a> - "CAAT is a director-based Scene graph manager. It is able to render using Canvas, WebGL and CSS w/o making changes to the developments that sit on top of it."</li>

<h2>Hello <strike>World</strike> JS Logo</h2>
<p>First you need a canvas element</p>
<pre>&lt;canvas id="demo" width="400" height="360"&gt;
	This text is displayed if your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>
<p>Next you wrap the element's 2D rendering context with canDo</p>
<pre>var demo = CanDo('demo', {
    frameRate: 60,
    duration: 2000,
    easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
    events: {
        mouseover: function () {demo.play({speed:1});},
        mouseout: function () {demo.play({speed:-1});}
    }
});</pre>
<p>When you do that you need to pass in some parameters, not least of which is your paint () function. Here we're setting it after the fact</p>
<pre>demo.paint = function() {
        this.identity();
        this.clearRect(0, 0, 400, 360);
        this.translate(160, 160);
        
        this.canDo('rotate', [{params: [0],cuePoint: 0},{params: [44],cuePoint: 1}]);
        this.translate(-105, -105);
        this.canDo('scale', [{params: [0.1, 0.1],cuePoint: 0},{params: [1.0, 1.0],cuePoint: 1}]);
        this.canSet('shadowColor', [{params: ['rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)'], cuePoint:0},{params:['rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'], cuePoint: 1}]);
        this.canSet('shadowOffsetX', [{params: [3],cuePoint: 0},{params: [90],cuePoint: 1}]);
        this.canSet('shadowOffsetY', [{params: [3],cuePoint: 0},{params: [50],cuePoint: 1}]);
        this.canSet('shadowBlur', [{params: [3],cuePoint: 0},{params: [20],cuePoint: 1}]);
        
        drawJSBox(this);
        this.shadowOffsetX = 0;
        this.shadowOffsetY = 0;
        this.shadowBlur = 0;
        drawJ(this);
        drawS(this);
    }</pre>

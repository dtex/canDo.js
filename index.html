<h3>canDo.js Introduction</h2>
<p>canDo.js is a canvas wrapper for lightweight animations. It gives you a timeline, cupoints, tweening, basic events and easing functions. It is ideal for animating simple UI elements (i.e. buttons). In a nutshell, canDo.js proxies the methods of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">HTML Canvas 2D Context</a> and allows you to add keyframes to the properties you pass in. canDo.JS handles the rest.</p>
<p>You are still free to use the non-proxied built-in functions when appropriate.</p>

<p>First you need a canvas element.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a reference to your canDo wrapped 2D rendering context. When you do that you need to pass in some parameters, not least of witch is your paint () function.</p>
<p>Finally you call play on your canDo object.</p>
<p>And we end up with something like this:</p>

canDo.js is a canvas wrapper for lightweight animations. It is ideal for animating simple UI elements (i.e. buttons, and little graphical widgets). In a nutshell, canDo.js proxies the methods of the HTML Canvas 2D Context, and allows you to add keyframes and easing functions to the properties you pass in. canDo.JS handles the rest.

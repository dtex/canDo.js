canDo.js is a canvas wrapper for simple animations. It is ideal for animating UI elements (i.e. buttons with hover states). In a nutshell, canDo.js proxies the methods of the HTML Canvas 2D Context. It allows you to define a timeline, keyframes and easing functions.

"This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty whatsoever"*

Issues I need to resolve before v1.0:

* New improved easing
* Refactor to appropriate pattern (just sandboxed for now)
* Code optimization (nuke nested ifs and the like)
* Minification optimization
* Hotspot events Over, Click, Out

*Quoting Tim Berners-Lee, but of course he was talking about something else.
